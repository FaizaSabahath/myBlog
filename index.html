        <p> <b> My Favorite Hobby is Cooking👩🏻‍🍳. I came to like cooking because I once saw my mother cooking the Lunch happily, I asked Mom "Why are you cooking so happily? Don't you get tired by cooking??" My Mom told me that "If you cook by love❤️ and happiness🙂 the food will turn out very delicious😋!" So then I made a Pancake🥞 with love❤️ and happiness🙂 and it turned out that it was a really really delicious😋 pancake! That's why I love❤️ cooking👩🏻‍🍳. </b> </p> <br> <br>

    <section id="para">
    My favourite hobby is cooking. I love to do cooking on holidays. I like to try out new and unique cuisines from different places around the world. It improves my knowledge not only about the vegetation and food habits of the people in that particular area, but it also let me know the type of vegetation there.

I usually prefer to cook fresh vegetables with sauces and other ingredients, which are healthy, easy to prepare and looks good to serve. More often than not I also like to prepare different kind of desserts from various parts around the world.
